Fmb GTK Style Properties
===========================

  Several user interface elements in Fmb are customizable via the standard
  GTK style mechanism. Besides the customization provided by the GTK widgets,
  that are used in Fmb, there are a bunch of additional settings that can
  be customized via the GTK theme or the ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file in the users home
  directory.

  The following list includes the customizable widgets and the settings that
  can be customized for this widgets.


FmbAbstractIconView
----------------------

  The FmbAbstractIconView widget class is the base class for both the
  FmbIconView (the "Icon View") and the FmbCompactView (the "Compact
  List View"). It provides two additional settings that can be customized:

   * column-spacing (0...)

     The additional space inserted between columns in the icon and
     compact view. Defaults to 6 for both the icon and the compact
     view.

   * row-spacing (0...)

     The additional space inserted between rows in the icon and
     compact view. Defaults to 6 for the icon view and 0 for the
     compact view.

  For example, say you want to reduce the additional spacing for the icon view
  to 3 pixel, then you can put the following lines in the file ~/.gtkrc-2.0 in
  your home directory (just create the file if it is not already present):

   style "fmb-icon-view-reduced-style"
   {
     FmbIconView::column-spacing = 3
     FmbIconView::row-spacing = 3
   }

   class "FmbIconView" style "fmb-icon-view-reduced-style"


FmbPathEntry
---------------

  The FmbPathEntry widget class is used for the location bar, both in the
  traditional location selector and the "Open Location" dialog. The path entry
  displays an icon right before the path, whose size can be customized via the

   * icon-size (16/22/24/33/36/48/64/72/96/128/192)

  style property. For example to increase the size to 24 pixel, you can put the
  following lines in the file ~/.gtkrc-2.0:

   style "fmb-path-entry-increased-style"
   {
     FmbPathEntry::icon-size = 24
   }

   class "FmbPathEntry" style "fmb-path-entry-increased-style"

  You should however make sure that your icon theme supports the icon size,
  otherwise you might end up with ugly up/down-scaled icons.


FmbLocationButtons
---------------------

  The FmbLocationButtons widget class is used for the path bar style loca-
  tion selector. It provides the following customizable style properties:

   * spacing (0...)

     The amount of space inserted between the path buttons. Defaults to
     3 pixels.
