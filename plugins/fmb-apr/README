Fmb Advanced Properties (fmb-apr)
=======================================

Fmb-apr is an extension to Fmb, which provides additional pages for
the file properties dialog, that are displayed for certain kinds of files:

 * Launcher/Link
 * Image

The Launcher/Link page is displayed for .desktop files and allows users to
easily edit the most important values (i.e. the command for a launcher and
the URL for a link).

The Image page is displayed for all kinds of image files supported by the
GTK+ version used by Fmb. The page displays atleast the exact format of
the image and the dimensions in pixels. If the plugin is build with support
for libexif (you can explicitly disable this using the `--disable-exif'
configure option) and the image file includes Exif tags, the most important
Exif tags found in the image file will also be displayed.

By default the fmb-apr extension will be installed, but as with every
extension, it will slightly increase the resource usage of Fmb (this
shouldn't be a real problem unless you're targeting an embedded system),
and so you can pass `--disable-apr-plugin' to configure and the plugin
won't be built and installed. Since it is an extension, you can also
easily uninstall it afterwards by removing the fmb-apr.so file from
the lib/fmbx-2/ directory of your installation (be sure to quit Fmb
before removing files though).
