Fmb User Customizable Actions (fmb-uca)
=============================================

Fmb-uca is an extension to Fmb, which enables sophisticated users to add
additional actions to the file managers context menus, without having to write
their own extensions for each and every action they want to use.

By default the fmb-uca extension will be installed, but as with every
extension, it will slightly increase the resource usage of Fmb (this
shouldn't be a real problem unless you're targeting an embedded system), and so
can you pass `--disable-uca-plugin' to configure and the plugin won't be built
and installed. Since it is an extension, you can also easily uninstall it
afterwards by removing the fmb-uca.so file from the lib/fmbx-2/ directory
of your installation (be sure to quit Fmb before removing files though).

To actually manage the actions open the "Edit" menu in the menu bar of a
Fmb window and select "Configure Custom Actions...". A dialog will appear
which lists the currently configured actions.
